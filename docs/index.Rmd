## Covid Report
As you can see by the chart, at the end of every year, a spike in cases occurs which leads into the next year. The total number of cases is `r get_total_cases()`, and the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 


I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
